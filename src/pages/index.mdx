# Hello

I am a Software Engineer based in London, UK. I have been coding since 2011. I
began my engineering career in digital agencies, including
[Ostmodern](https://www.ostmodern.co.uk/), where I worked on [BBC
Player](https://player.bbc.com/) for BBC Worldwide (now [BBC
Studios](https://www.bbcstudios.com/)), [Britain on
Film](https://player.bfi.org.uk/britain-on-film) for
[BFI](https://www.bfi.org.uk/), as well as [Olympic
Channel](https://www.olympicchannel.com/). This experience gave me the edge I
needed to find a job at global fintech [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/),
where I joined as a front-end developer. I couldn’t be more proud of my time at
one of London’s fastest growing fintechs. The mad rush of an agency was over and
it was all about quality. Start with why and everything else follows. While at
Ostmodern I discovered the tools, at GoCardless I used every single one of them.
I later moved on to work for online sourcing platform
[eporta](https://www.eporta.com/) and then onto online insurance broker [Simply
Business](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/).
